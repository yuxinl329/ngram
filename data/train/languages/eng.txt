This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people.

I didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
Maybe I should give them a hand.
Try to get them on the phone.
He who seeks will find.
Tom said that Mary was crazy.
He couldn't stop staring at her.
It was hard for him to stop working.
I wonder whether or not Tom knew we had to do that.
I wanted to see you tonight.
You don't seem to know who we are.
Tom married a girl much younger than himself.
How long are you going to be seeing that loser of a boyfriend?
The plant's closure spelt disaster for the town.
Tom is pretty aggressive.

I must go back.
Tom knows him.
They say they're lonely.
Tom doesn't like the kind of jokes Mary tells.
You don't seem to like anything.
I got in the car with Tom.
I can't talk to Tom now.
We were late because of the storm.
We were married five years ago today.
We walked to my room.
I think that won't happen.
Who could have done that?
Tom saw what Mary was eating.
He is fashionable.
Where did Tom have his new suit made?
That could happen to anyone.
I never do that on Mondays.
Tom and Mary told me that they were stuffed.
I don't like Chinese food very much.
That was surprising.
It's just the right thing to do.
I think Tom went to Boston last month.
Tom is a lot better than people think.
Tom said Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him.

Tom is a bit snobbish.
I think Tom and Mary are difficult to get along with.
Tom and Mary must love each other very much.
I'll be right there.

I'm going to be too busy to do that.
I know I'm dying.
He truly is a prodigy.
I want to know how many times you've been to Australia.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so angry.
A good citizen obeys the laws.
I'll get us some drinks.
They had lived there until they came to Tokyo.
Tom said that he'd assumed that Mary would win.
Tom and I know why Mary lied.
Sami is going to be back from Cairo any minute.

Tom won't have to do that.
Could I have a bus timetable?
I think you might need to study a little harder.
Sami is a lazy boy.
Mary said she'd go back home soon.
Tom kept interrupting me.
The soldier gave me water.

I didn't sneak up on them.
He asked her out on a date.
What did Tom want to show us?
The sleigh glided swiftly over the ice.
I've lost my bag.
Tom and Mary don't like John calling them at work.
This car prototype is dangerously unreliable.
I've never seen him like that.
Tom left for a second.
I know Tom is a strong man.
Sami wanted to send the authorities a message: I'm smarter than you.
I had to see you to give you a warning.
Sami was saving up.
Tom was sleeping when the doorbell rang.
Rome is burning.
I didn't even notice her.
They said that they had no plans to do that.
What the devil are you doing?
Mary lives all by herself.
I thought that Tom would be reasonable.
They ate salad on the cliff, but got sick on the hike back.
She pruned a tree.
Sami wasn't very sick.
I can carry that.
Actually, I meant something else.
Without your aid, I couldn't have succeeded.

I liked teaching French.
I had a marvelous view of Mt. Fuji.
Tom admitted that he didn't do what he promised to do.
Her dress was ruined.

They think their government doesn't care about them.
I cannot card the wool. This is Taninna's job.

We skied down to Chamonix.
The company asked the bank to loan them some money to buy new machinery.
You're going to have to be quick.

Next week, we're heading to the mountain.
Tom often made us laugh.
I think Tom and Mary hate us.
Sami hid in the back of the truck.
Tom and I adopted a girl.
At that time, my house was still being built.
I wonder whether or not Tom really enjoys doing that.
I have a lot of problems of my own.
Koko knows and uses more than 500 words in sign language, the language of deaf people.
How do you find the time to exercise?
They wanted to know where Tom was.
Tom tells everyone that he can't speak French, but that's not true.
Tom put on some music.
I thought Tom might do that.
I hope that Tom saw what you did.
Has anyone told Tom why he has to do that?
They did everything they could.
Tom has what we all want.
Tom was there when his mother killed herself.
Why did Tom give you that?

I'm working too much.
The station is near here. You'll be in time for the train.
Tom knew that Mary was scared.
I grabbed Mary by the elbow.
Please help conserve water.
Fortunately, he was free of debt.
I called ahead.
I'm feeling a little frisky.
Do you really have enough money to buy everything you want?
Please don't smoke.
The children thought that their parents were made of money.
That's exactly what Tom ended up doing.
My mother is making my father a cake.
I think the eggs that I just ate were rotten.
There's something I need to talk to you about.
Do you want to wait in the bar?
I broke your dish.
Why didn't you stay with Tom?
Why would she lie?
Sami lived really crazy.
Who's going to tell us?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
I can't believe what an idiot I've been.
Why did Tom give that to Mary?
Nobody can foresee what'll happen.
It'll probably be impossible for you to do that by yourself.
But everyone else is still.
Tom wasn't the last to find out about it.
Can you help me move the table?
Mary said she didn't have to do that until Monday.
Were you drinking that day?
She fixed him something to eat.

Calm your nerves.
I'm getting ready to bake a cake.
Why doesn't anybody believe us?

Sami didn't come to take the flowers.
At least that part's true.
Once there lived an old man in the village.
My sister told her to leave me alone.
My boss would not let me leave work early.
It appears she will have to work harder.
Is that really Tom's sister?
I don't think that Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
Show me your driving license, please.
Mary is breast-feeding her baby.
The bell chimed them to meals.
Tom said he knew it was time to go.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I? "No, of course not."
He was approaching.
How can we possibly do that?
Bring your best game.
They told me that they could take it.
They broke off their engagement.
Tom didn't seem to be desperate to do that.
We're having the same problems that Tom is having.
It looked like Tom was surprised.
Tom broke the door window, reached inside, unlocked the door and got into the car.
He said that he takes a walk in the park every morning.

One of my classmates used to live in Australia.
Tom wasn't jumping on the bed.
Ah, I forgot to ask. Before you said you hadn't seen he umbrella. Have you found it since?
Sami moved to a quiet street.
A computer game was given to me by my father.
All humans are mortal is an empirical observation based on millennia of experience.
We both can do that.
I don't want to mess that up.
Are you saying you don't want to go?
Do you like apples or oranges?
Why have you kept it a secret?
Tom isn't the only one who knows where Mary is right now.
He said he'd rather not eat now.
I wasn't talking...
Seeing that she is tired, we had better stop for a while.
He banged the door in anger.
I don't dream.
There was damage to the computer.
Just don't worry.
Put on your clothes.
You pull up the blanket.
I'm writing to him.
Sami wanted to grow his hair long.
Tom's flashlight died on him before he could get out of the cave.
Both Tom and I'll be busy this afternoon.
Mary decided to go to Boston by herself.
Please send it by express mail.

Tom isn't at home.

We'll try.
Tom and Mary should do that as soon as they can.
Keep the secret.

That was predictable.
Tom didn't seem to be as methodical as Mary seemed to be.
I don't know how Tom talked you into it.
You must come with us.
Children are playing with toys.
We spread out and began to search through the woods.
That couple spends quite a bit of money eating at nice restaurants.
I hope it will clear up soon.

Do you intend to join that tennis club?
What was it you were going to say?
She told me that she'd walk home.
We tricked Tom.
I wondered whether Tom wanted to dance or not.
It could've been worse. You could've died.
You're the one who said I should to that.
Can we fish there?
What would you advise, Tom?
I don't know how to contact Tom.
It was a great success, ending in a long run.
I'm going to be here for a couple of hours.
Sami punched Layla in the head.
What other option is there?
I'm also not very good at doing that.
Tom is likely going to be punished for eating all the cookies.
